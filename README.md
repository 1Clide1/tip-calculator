## Description

This is a cool app that I am making to find out how much I need to tip when I get the bill. I built this for people interested in dinning out and wanting an easier way to tip the right amount. I also built this for people who wanted a little more from their calculator app and that are interested in knowing their stats or other bonus features. If people are not interested they can still use the calculator for it's intended purpose. The calculator supports finding out the tip of an individual person or if this is a person using the app in a group and currently supports people to view their profile's stats for individual tips as of right now. I don't see a lot of people giving calculators like this much interest or effort into making a good one or one that seems fun to use. I want to change that and try to make something people would actually want to use and something that could be useful. As of now this is a work in progress, will update the readme if changes occur until the program is considered finished. As of now I hope you enjoy the app!!

## Usage

The use case for this app is users (in a group setting or not) who want to have an easier way on knowing how much to tip. If there are more of a power user, they can sign up and create an account to view their profile's stats and change the color theme of the website (still a WIP) although this is more of a hidden optional use case.

## Credits

As of right now this project is still going. It's helped me learn a lot about react and how to properly use that library to stay organized and also to make this simple app feel more modern than the more dated versions out there already. So far I can say graphql is very simple yet confusing to use will have to properly implement my changes to see if my opinion changes. Project is moving slowly but surely and I feel like it's been huge in helping me learn which is really important like I said. Close to being finished, Will update the readme to keep up with the changes.
